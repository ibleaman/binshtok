### Project Origin
This project is based off of NYT's [Spelling Bee Puzzles](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).
<br>You must have NYT puzzle membership to play the game on New York Times.

Sabrina and I loved playing this game so much during a semester long study abroad experience that we decided to build it for ourselves. 

The game we made can be found at: http://spellingbee.xyz/
<br>The letter combinations refresh daily at 4am EST. 

Here is an example of what it looks like:
